## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide an API for breast cancer detection. It uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on input data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.7 or higher.
- You have a working internet connection to install the required packages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BreastCancerProject.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd BreastCancerProject
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the API, run the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /predict`: Takes input data and returns the prediction result.

## Example Request

Here is an example of how to make a request to the `/predict` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}'
```
